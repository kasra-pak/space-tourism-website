## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
- In this project, I decided to not use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and started the project from scratch. This made me gain some insight on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) workflow and configurations.

- It was my first time using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) in a project; Passing props from jsx to css is a very usefull feature.

### Useful resources

- [React & Webpack 4 From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deyxI-6C2u4) - Helped me write my own [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configurations for React App without using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- [@supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) - This is an amazing CSS at-rule which helped me add `backdrop-filter` porperty only if the client browser supports it.
